# ENGR103 Final Project - Pattern Matcher

### Concept
When the game starts, the board will display a pattern using the 10 NeoPixels. The player is tasked with quickly memorizing the pattern and then utilizing a combination of inputs (buttons and switches) to recreate the pattern. 

### Difficulty Progression
The game will start with only a single NeoPixel and as the user progresses through levels, the number of NeoPixels used for the pattern will increase until the player reaches a stage where all ten NeoPixel are being used. To further increase difficulty beyond this, the pace will be sped up and the player will only have a short duration to memorize the pattern.

### Scoring
Scoring will be based on the accuracy and time taken.
