# ENGR103 Final Project - Pattern Matcher

### Concept
When the game starts, the board will display a pattern using the 10 NeoPixels. The player is tasked with quickly memorizing the pattern and then utilizing a combination of inputs (buttons and switches) to recreate the pattern.

### Difficulty Progression
The game will start with only a single NeoPixel and as the user progresses through levels, the number of NeoPixels used for the pattern will increase until the player reaches a stage where all ten NeoPixel are being used. To further increase difficulty beyond this, the pace will be sped up and the player will only have a short duration to memorize the pattern.

### Scoring
Scoring will be based on the accuracy and time taken. The time taken for a level will be mapped in reverse to a min and max score for a level. This will ensure that the player isnâ€™t penalized for taking the minimum amount of time while ensuring they still get some points despite spending a long time on a level.
